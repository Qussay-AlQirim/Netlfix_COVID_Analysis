# Netlfix and COVID analysis and visualization

<p>
  The project at hand focuses on analysing two different datasets, Netflix and COVID, with the objective of producing visualizations to answer a set of proposed questions. As a data analyst, in order to ask insightful questions, a comprehensive understanding of the dataset is essential. This would allow the analyst to realize different attributes, data types and data quality, in turn acting as a starting point for data modelling and piecing attributes together to answer questions.

Set of questions to answer:
  - Netflix Data:
    - Which Country has the highest amount of Movies?
    - Which Movie has the highest IMDB Score?
    - Content split between series and Movies
